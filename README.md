# Rust Command Line Project. 

I'm teaching myself Rust using this tutorial: https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/cli-args.html

To run the code currently, I do this:
```bash
cargo run test test
```

## Learnings
- VSCode started showing inferred types called "inlay hints". I updated my vscode to toggle these off when I press `ctrl+ alt` as they seem useful but possibly annoying if I can't toggle them. I'm curious whether I can auto-add them to code and if other crustaceans don't like/want that then why not?
